# üëã Welcome, I‚Äôm @MehmetBerkayC and i live in Turkey!
   I am a Computer Engineering graduate, so i'm mostly free, coding whenever i please, trying new things, and getting knowledge about how to manage complex projects.
   
  ### -> I'm interested in *Game and FrontEnd Web Development* also a bit of Backend coding.
  Experienced with **React, SQL, MongoDB, Unity(C#), Python** and **Java, JS** in general.
  <br>Can code effectively in **C#, Java, JavaScript, C, HTML, PHP, CSS** and **Python**. Also some other languages like *Haskell* and *MIPS*... 
  <br><br>I would love to get some advices for Game Development and Web Development.
  
  ### A bit of information about my work style.. ‚ùî
  - I like working with multiple people while keeping a professional distance. 
  - Mostly focus on writing clean codes. While learning something it won't be that accomplishable but, personal projects should be written with clean code.
  - If a project is present i will do my best to finish it; I hate leaving projects half way done, when i get started on a project that is worth my time, even sleep becomes a thing of the past...
  <br> -> I do not let go of a project unless it is finished. It is a trait of mine(at least i think of it this way). So if there is a problem **i'll waste my time trying solutions all day long!** 
  
  <br>**Until recently;**
  - I've had most of my projects left unfinished unless it was something work/intern/school related and didn't polish the ones i completed, so i don't usually put them up on github. 
  <br> -> If there is a project that is available here in my repositories, i probably didn't put it up here as soon as i started working on them...<br>
  
  ### Nowadays;
  Working on some game prototypes in Unity; Probably some already in repositories...
