# üëã Welcome, I‚Äôm @MehmetBerkayC and i live in Turkey!
   I am a Computer Engineering graduate, so i'm mostly free, coding whenever i please. Trying new things, and getting knowledgeable about how to manage complex projects.
   
  ### -> I'm interested in *Game and Web Development* also a bit of *Data Management* and *Server-Side(Backend)* coding.
  I'm experienced in **React, SQL, MongoDB, Unity, Python** and **Java, JS** in general.
  <br>Can code in **C#, Java, JavaScript, C, HTML, PHP, CSS** and **Python**. Also some other like *Haskell* and *MIPS*... 
  <br><br>I would love to get some advice or help regarding to Game Development in general, what engine to focus on, 3D or 2D development also should i learn animation making using Blender or etc.? 
  <br>Also it would be nice to have some additional advice regarding Web Development and Data Management for example what database system to use/master, MongoDB-SQL-Firebase... 
  
  ### A bit of information for my work style.. ‚ùî
  - I like working with multiple people; 
  <br> -> You can cover up others mistakes and as humans we do that pretty often. Guide each other to the right path.
  <br> -> Having some people which can guide and praise you for your deeds is a must in every work environment. Positivity is happiness, happy buddy is an efficient buddy...
  - I might seem a bit cold;
  <br> -> A proffesional workplace is a must for me and relations do not matter, thats why i can be seem cold.
  - If a project is present i will do my best to finish it;
  <br> -> I do not let go of a project unless it is finished. It is a trait of mine So if there is a problem **damn right i'll waste my time on it!** 
  <br> -> I desire to have a workplace that accompishes this, so that i can give my all! <br>
  <br>**Until recently;**
  - I've had most of my projects left unfinished unless it was something work/intern/school related and didn't polish the ones i completed that much, so i don't usually put them up on github. 
  <br> -> If there is a project that is available here in my repositories, i probably didn't put it up here as soon as i started working on them...<br>
  <br>##**Keep this in mind.**
   *I've had more time spent than what you'll see in GitHub..*
  
   
  ### Nowadays;
  Working on some game prototypes in Unity and making website prototypes using React and MongoDB
  #### I would love to work with some people to gain experience... Maturing up is accomplished by gaining experience, everyone needs some help maturing up! üòÉ
