# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome,
   I am a Computer Engineering graduate, trying new things and expanding my knowledge.
 
## -> I'm interested in *Game Development*.
  Experienced with **Unity(C#), Python, JavaScript**.
  
### A bit of information..
  - If there is a problem, I don't give up easily! After all, finding solutions what makes programming fun.
  - I've had most of my projects left unpolished or incomplete (mostly School/Intern related), so I don't usually put them up on github. 
  
 *Nowadays* <br>
  - Working on some game prototypes in Unity, probably some already available for viewing in my repositories...
