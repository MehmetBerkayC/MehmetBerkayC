# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, Iâ€™m @MehmetBerkayC and i live in Turkey!
   I am a Computer Engineering graduate, often free, coding whenever I please, trying new things, expanding my knowledge about how to manage complex projects.
 
## -> I'm interested in *Game and Front End Development* also a bit of Backend coding.
  Experienced with **React, SQL, MongoDB, Unity, Python** and **Java, JS** in general.
  <br>Can code effectively in **C#, Java, JavaScript, C, HTML, PHP, CSS** and **Python**. Also some other languages like *Haskell* and *MIPS*... <br>
  
### A bit of information about my work style..
  - I like working with multiple people while keeping a professional distance. 
  - Mostly focusing on writing clean codes. While learning something new, this will be less likely to happen.
  - If a project is present I will do my best to finish it; I hate leaving projects half way done.
  - If there is a problem I will waste my time trying to solve it all day long, after all finding solutions what makes programming fun.
  - I've had most of my projects left unpolished or incomplete (mostly School/Intern related), so I don't usually put them up on github. 
  
 *Nowadays* <br>
  - Working on some game prototypes in Unity, probably some already in repositories...
