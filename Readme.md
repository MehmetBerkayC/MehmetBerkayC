# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome,
   I am a Computer Engineering graduate, trying new things and expanding my knowledge.
 
## -> I'm interested in *Game and Front End Development*.
  Experienced with **React, SQL, MongoDB, Unity(C#), Python, Java, JavaScript**.
  <br>Can code effectively in **C#, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, CSS** and **Python**. Also some other languages like *Haskell* and *MIPS*... <br>
  
### A bit of information about my work style..
  - Mostly focusing on writing clean codes. While learning something new, this may not be the case though.
  - I hate leaving projects half way done.
  - If there is a problem I don't give up easily, after all finding solutions what makes programming fun.
  - I've had most of my projects left unpolished or incomplete (mostly School/Intern related), so I don't usually put them up on github. 
  
 *Nowadays* <br>
  - Working on some game prototypes in Unity, probably some already available for viewing in my repositories...
